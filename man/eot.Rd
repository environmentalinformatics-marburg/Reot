  \item{pred}{a ratser stack used as predictor}

  \code{resp}}

  \item{standardised}{logical. If \code{FALSE} the
  calculated r-squared values will be multiplied by the
  variance}

  \item{write.out}{logical. If \code{TRUE} results will be
  written to disk using \code{path.out}}

  \item{path.out}{the file path for writing results if
  \code{write.out} is \code{TRUE}. Defaults to current
  working directory}

  results if \code{write.out} is \code{TRUE}}

  \code{pred} and \code{resp} are reduced after each
  iteration. If \code{FALSE} only \code{resp} is reduced}

  \item{type}{the type of the link function. Defaults to
  \code{'rsq'} as in original proposed method from
  \cite{Dool2000}. If set to \code{'ioa'} index of
  agreement is used instead}

\value{
a list of \code{n} EOTs. Each EOT is also a list with the
following components: \itemize{ \item \emph{eot.series} -
the EOT time series at the identified base point \item
\emph{max.xy} - the cell number of the indeified base point
\item \emph{exp.var} - the (cumulative) explained variance
of the considered EOT \item \emph{loc.eot} - the location
of the base point (in original coordinates) \item
\emph{r.predictor} - the \emph{RasterLayer} of the
correlation coefficients between the base point and each
pixel of the predictor domain \item \emph{rsq.predictor} -
as above but for the coefficient of determination \item
\emph{rsq.sums.predictor} - as above but for the sums of
coefficient of determination \item \emph{int.predictor} -
the \emph{RasterLayer} of the intercept of the regression
equation for each pixel of the predictor domain \item
\emph{slp.predictor} - same as above but for the slope of
the regression equation for each pixel of the predictor
domain \item \emph{p.predictor} - the \emph{RasterLayer} of
the significance (p-value) of the the regression equation
for each pixel of the predictor domain \item
\emph{resid.predictor} - the \emph{RasterBrick} of the
reduced data for the predictor domain }

All \emph{*.predictor} fields are also returned for the
\emph{*.response} domain, even if predictor and response
domain are equal. This is due to that fact, that if not
both fields are reduced after the first EOT is found, these
\emph{RasterLayers} will differ.

\description{
Calculate a given number of EOT modes either internally or
between raster stacks.

\details{
The mathematics of the EOT algorithm are described in
detail in \cite{Dool2000} and \cite{Dool2007} and can be
summarised as follows. First, the temporal profiles of each
pixel \emph{np} of the predictor domain are regressed
against the profiles of all pixels \emph{nr} in the
response domain (in case of only a single field \emph{nr} =
\emph{np} - 1). The calculated coefficients of
determination are summed up and the pixel with the highest
sum for explaining variance within the response domain is
identified as the 'base point' of the first/leading mode.
The temporal profile at this base point is the
first/leading EOT. Then, the residuals from the regression
are taken to be the basis for the calculation of the next
EOT, thus ensuring orthogonality of the identified
teleconnections. This procedure is repeated until a
predefined amount of \emph{n} EOTs is calculated. In
general, \pkg{Reot} implements a 'brute force' spatial data
mining approach to identify locations of enhanced potential
to explain spatio-temporal variability within the same or
another geographic field.
